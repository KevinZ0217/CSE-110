# About
I'm Kevin Zhang, a third year undergraduate student majoring in **Cognitive Science** and **Math-Computer Science** at University 
of California, San Diego. I'm interested in neuroscience, machine learning, and I'm also a Brain-Computer interface enthusiast, 
currently working in a neuroscience lab to gain some wet lab experiences. I'm also interested in software engineering, and I'm trying 
to figure out the principles that define a good software engineer in this class. Outside of academics, I love beatboxing, speedcubing
(with best records of 16 secs!), FPS gaming, and table tennis.


# Picture sharing
I would like to share some of my responsibilities as a RA in my neuroscience lab.

```
public void lectureEvaluator(int numOfMeme){
    if(numOfMeme > 5){
        System.out.println("Zzzzzz");
    }
    else{
        System.out.println("Damn so hardcore this is the best lecture ever!!!!!");
    }
}
Just kidding, plz don't kick me out of the class. :))
